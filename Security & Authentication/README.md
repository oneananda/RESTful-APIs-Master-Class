# Security & Authentication

Securing your API is paramount to ensuring that only authorized users can access your services and data. In this section, you'll find strategies, best practices, and code examples to implement robust security and authentication for your RESTful APIs.

## Why Security Matters

- **Protect Sensitive Data:** Prevent unauthorized access to confidential information.
- **Ensure Integrity:** Maintain the trustworthiness of your API by blocking malicious attacks.
- **Comply with Standards:** Meet regulatory requirements and industry best practices.
- **Enhance User Trust:** Demonstrate your commitment to security for your users and partners.

## Common Authentication Methods

### 1. API Keys
- **Usage:** Often used for simple integrations or internal applications.
- **Pros:** Easy to implement and manage.
- **Cons:** Lacks granularity and may be vulnerable if keys are exposed.

### 2. Token-Based Authentication (JWT)
- **Usage:** Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely transmit claims between parties.
- **Pros:** Stateless, scalable, and suitable for distributed systems.
- **Cons:** Requires secure management of tokens and proper expiration handling.

### 3. OAuth 2.0
- **Usage:** Provides delegated authorization for third-party access without exposing user credentials.
- **Pros:** Offers granular permissions and supports multiple flows (e.g., Authorization Code, Implicit, Client Credentials).
- **Cons:** Can be complex to implement and configure properly.

### 4. Basic Authentication
- **Usage:** Encodes username and password in HTTP headers.
- **Pros:** Simple to implement.
- **Cons:** Insecure over non-HTTPS connections and lacks advanced features.

## Implementation Best Practices

- **Use HTTPS:** Always encrypt communication between clients and your API.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement throttling to mitigate brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Secure Storage:** Store sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) in environment variables or secure vaults.
- **Error Handling:** Avoid exposing internal logic or sensitive information in error messages.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Track access and authentication attempts to identify and respond to potential breaches.
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review and update security policies and codebases.

## Example: Implementing JWT in Node.js

Below is a basic example of how to generate and validate JWT tokens using Node.js and Express:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const secretKey = process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'your-secret-key';

// Generate a token for an authenticated user
function generateToken(user) {
  return jwt.sign({ id: user.id, email: user.email }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });
}

// Middleware to authenticate and validate the token
function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.sendStatus(401); // Unauthorized

  jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.sendStatus(403); // Forbidden
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
}

module.exports = { generateToken, authenticateToken };
