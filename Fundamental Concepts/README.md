# Fundamental Concepts of RESTful APIs

Welcome to the **Fundamental Concepts** section of the RESTful APIs Master Class. This guide introduces you to the core principles and architectural decisions behind RESTful API design. A solid understanding of these fundamentals will help you design scalable, efficient, and maintainable APIs.

## What is REST?

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It leverages standard HTTP protocols and is built around a set of guiding principles to ensure scalability, performance, and modifiability.

## Core Principles of REST

### 1. Client-Server Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns:** The client (user interface) is separated from the server (data storage and business logic). This improves portability and scalability.
- **Simplified Development:** Developers can work on the client and server independently, using different technologies if desired.

### 2. Statelessness

- **No Client Context Stored on Server:** Every request from the client must contain all the information necessary for the server to fulfill the request.
- **Scalability Benefits:** Since each request is independent, servers can easily scale out by handling requests without shared session state.

### 3. Cacheability

- **Improved Performance:** Responses should indicate whether they are cacheable. Caching responses can reduce server load and improve user experience.
- **Efficiency:** Proper caching minimizes repeated requests for the same resources.

### 4. Layered System

- **Encapsulation:** The client need not know whether it’s communicating directly with the end server or an intermediary (e.g., a proxy or load balancer).
- **Flexibility:** Layers can be added or modified to enhance security, load balancing, or caching without impacting the client.

### 5. Uniform Interface

- **Simplified Communication:** A consistent interface between components (clients and servers) makes the system easier to understand and evolve.
- **Resource Manipulation via Representations:** Clients interact with resources using standardized HTTP methods and media types (such as JSON or XML).

### 6. Code on Demand (Optional)

- **Extending Client Functionality:** Servers can optionally send executable code (e.g., JavaScript) to the client, extending its functionality dynamically.
- **Flexibility vs. Complexity:** While powerful, this principle is less commonly used due to security and complexity considerations.

## HTTP Methods and Their Usage

RESTful APIs typically use standard HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations:

- **GET:** Retrieve a resource or list of resources.
- **POST:** Create a new resource.
- **PUT:** Update an existing resource entirely.
- **PATCH:** Partially update an existing resource.
- **DELETE:** Remove a resource.

Each method plays a specific role in the API's operations, ensuring clear semantics and behavior.
