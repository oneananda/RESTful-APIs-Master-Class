## 1. Consistent Naming Conventions

- **Resource Naming:**  
  Use clear, descriptive names for your resources. Favor nouns over verbs (e.g., `/users` instead of `/getUsers`).

- **Pluralization:**  
  Use plural nouns for collections (e.g., `/users`, `/orders`) and singular for individual items when appropriate.

- **URI Structure:**  
  Organize URIs hierarchically to reflect resource relationships. For example:

## 2. Use Standard HTTP Methods

Stick to the conventional HTTP methods to make your API intuitive:

- **GET:** Retrieve data.
- **POST:** Create new resources.
- **PUT:** Update existing resources completely.
- **PATCH:** Partially update resources.
- **DELETE:** Remove resources.
