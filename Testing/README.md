# Testing

Testing is a cornerstone of building robust and reliable RESTful APIs. This section covers various testing methodologies, tools, and best practices to ensure that your API performs as expected and can handle both expected and unexpected inputs.

## Why Testing Matters

- **Quality Assurance:** Catch bugs and regressions early in the development cycle.
- **Reliability:** Confirm that individual components and overall API workflows function correctly.
- **Performance & Scalability:** Validate that your API can manage heavy loads and scale effectively.
- **Security:** Ensure that security measures work as intended and that vulnerabilities are identified.
