# API Versioning

A practical guide for choosing, implementing, and maintaining a safe versioning strategy for your APIs (REST, GraphQL, gRPC).

---

## Why Version?

- **Protect clients** from breaking changes  
- **Enable evolution** of your API surface  
- **Communicate change** with clear contracts and timelines  
- **Run side-by-side** versions to enable gradual migrations

## Core Principles

1. **Prefer backward-compatible changes** (additive).  
2. **Version only when truly breaking.**  
3. **Be predictable** â€” one documented policy for versioning and deprecation.  
4. **Automate** validation, contract tests, and usage metrics per version.
