# Security & Authentication

Securing your API is paramount to ensuring that only authorized users can access your services and data. In this section, you'll find strategies, best practices, and code examples to implement robust security and authentication for your RESTful APIs.

## Why Security Matters

- **Protect Sensitive Data:** Prevent unauthorized access to confidential information.
- **Ensure Integrity:** Maintain the trustworthiness of your API by blocking malicious attacks.
- **Comply with Standards:** Meet regulatory requirements and industry best practices.
- **Enhance User Trust:** Demonstrate your commitment to security for your users and partners.

## Common Authentication Methods

### 1. API Keys
- **Usage:** Often used for simple integrations or internal applications.
- **Pros:** Easy to implement and manage.
- **Cons:** Lacks granularity and may be vulnerable if keys are exposed.

### 2. Token-Based Authentication (JWT)
- **Usage:** Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely transmit claims between parties.
- **Pros:** Stateless, scalable, and suitable for distributed systems.
- **Cons:** Requires secure management of tokens and proper expiration handling.

### 3. OAuth 2.0
- **Usage:** Provides delegated authorization for third-party access without exposing user credentials.
- **Pros:** Offers granular permissions and supports multiple flows (e.g., Authorization Code, Implicit, Client Credentials).
- **Cons:** Can be complex to implement and configure properly.
