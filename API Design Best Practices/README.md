# API Design Best Practices

Welcome to the **API Design Best Practices** section of the RESTful APIs Master Class. In this guide, you'll learn how to design APIs that are intuitive, consistent, and maintainable. Following these best practices will ensure a great developer experience and make your API easier to integrate, scale, and secure.

## 1. Consistent Naming Conventions

- **Resource Naming:**  
  Use clear, descriptive names for your resources. Favor nouns over verbs (e.g., `/users` instead of `/getUsers`).

- **Pluralization:**  
  Use plural nouns for collections (e.g., `/users`, `/orders`) and singular for individual items when appropriate.

- **URI Structure:**  
  Organize URIs hierarchically to reflect resource relationships. For example:

## 2. Use Standard HTTP Methods

Stick to the conventional HTTP methods to make your API intuitive:

- **GET:** Retrieve data.
- **POST:** Create new resources.
- **PUT:** Update existing resources completely.
- **PATCH:** Partially update resources.
- **DELETE:** Remove resources.

## 3. Versioning Your API

- **URI Versioning:**  
Include a version number in your URI (e.g., `/v1/users`) to clearly communicate the API version.

- **Header Versioning:**  
Alternatively, consider using custom headers to manage versions, which keeps the URI clean.

- **Backward Compatibility:**  
Plan for future changes by ensuring older versions remain functional or by establishing clear deprecation policies.
